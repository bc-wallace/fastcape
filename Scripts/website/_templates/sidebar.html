        I am a weather enthusiast with a strong interest in climate science, big data and efficiency. Originally from Chicago, Illinois, I grew up fascinated by tornadoes and severe weather. I received my B.Sc in Meteorology with a concentration in Geographic Information Systems and Mathematics from Western Illinois University before later attending graduate school at the University at Albany where I received my M.S and PhD in Atmospheric Science.

        Outside work, I enjoy hiking, board games, traveling, and archiving digital media.
